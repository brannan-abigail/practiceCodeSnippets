# practiceCodeSnippets
This is a repository to maintain and display my knowledge of different algorithms and data structures in different languages; intended to only contain code contributions by Abby Brannan, the creator.

The questions used to practice will come mainly from coding challenge web sites and the 'Cracking the Coding Interview Book' (which will be properly sourced).

I will begin these challenges in the languanges that I'm most comfortable in: Java, C++ and JavaScript. I would like to add in alternative ways to solve the problems using a more Functional approach later on in Python, and later on in Haskell when I am more comfortable with these. The goal here is to become familiar with the different tools and approaches that these languages take to get more accustomed to the nuances.

Hopefully I will be able to update this repository frequently! I want to get into the habit of practicing high-level coding on my own regularly, but there may be long gaps where it doesn't get updated as school, work, internships and/or life in general becomes too hectic.

Feel free to leave constructive comments on how I can improve my code! Always improving.
